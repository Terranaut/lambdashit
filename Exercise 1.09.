Exercise  1.9.
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, 
which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating 
(+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive? 



;;a = 4 and b = 5

;;(if (= a 0)
;;	b
;;	(inc (+ (dec a) b))))

;; So we're gonna be looping until a is 0.


;; (inc (+ (dec a) b)))
;;(inc (+ 3 5))
;;(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5))))
;;(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
;;(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5)))))
;;(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
;;(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
;;(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
;;(inc (inc (inc 6)))
;;(inc (inc 7))
;;(inc 8)
;;9
;;This is recursive.


;;(+ (dec a) (inc b))
;;Same loop.
;;(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
;;(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
;;(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
;;(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
;;(+ 0 9)
;;9
;;This is iterative.
