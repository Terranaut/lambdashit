Exercise 1.12. The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle.
The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the
two numbers above it. 35 Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a
recursive process. 

;;(define (pt r c)
;;    (cond ((< r c) #f)
;;          ((or (= 0 c) (= r c)) 1)
;;          (else (+ (pt (- r 1) c)
;;                  (pt (- r 1) (- c 1))))))

;;Note: Not doing 1.13., I don't even know the mathematical symbols used, lol.
