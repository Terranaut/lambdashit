Exercise 1.11. A function f is defined by the rule that f(n) = n if n<3 and f(n) = f(n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) +
3f(n - 3) if n> 3. Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive process. Write a procedure
that computes f by means of an iterative process. 

;;Recursively:
;;(define (f n)
;;    (if (< n 3)
;;        n
;;        (+ (f (- n 1)) (* 2 (f (- n 2))) (* 3 (f (- n 3))))))

;;I had to get a good chunk of help for the iterative one, so I'm not taking any credit for completing it. Essentially, I didn't. RIP.
;;(define (f n)
;;   (if (< n 3)
;;       n
;;       (f-iter 2 1 0 n)))
;;
;;(define (f-iter a b c count)
;;   (if (< count 3)
;;       a
;;       (f-iter (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c))
;;               a
;;               b
;;               (- count 1))))
